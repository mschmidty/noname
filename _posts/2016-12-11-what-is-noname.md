So what is this no name blog? To be honest, I don't really know yet. I started another blog [schmidtyworks.com][schmidtyworks] that was intended to be a platform to blog about my work as a wildife bioligist for the Bureau of Land Management.  I'll keep that blog going along with this one.  But writing about land management is bettter suited to a technical style.  While I think writing technically would help me grow as a biologist.  I don't want to do that with this blog.  I want to publish my free flowing thoughts, not just my technical work endevors.
