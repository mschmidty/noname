The Bureau of Land Management is one of the biggest federal land management agencies in the United States. It manages 247.3 million surface and almost 700 million subsurface (mineral estate) acres. That's insane. In comparison the Forest Service manages 193 million acres and the Park Service manages just 84 million, and neither manages any subsurface mineral rights. Yet, despite it being by far the biggest land manager, the BLM, seems to get the least amount of fanfare.  I'd like to change that.  It's not that I think that the BLM is the best managed federal land management agency, has the best lands, or is the best to visit.  But by far, it is the agency with the most land at under its stewardship and therefore has the greatest potential to alter the United States landscape.

And with any story, to really understand it, you need to start at the beginning. And for the BLM, that beginning is complicated.  It involves a lot of leftover land, the combining of two land management agencies and a lot of uses on a very diverse landscape.
