Twice a year my friends and I gather in the desert for a celebration.  We named it "The Perversion".  This past weekend was the 10th biannual (I think). Really, the gathering has nothing to do with being perverted, but instead is more about bringing friends together who have moved away or we don't have time to see because we are so busy.  People dress up in costumes, we make tacos, we have a huge camp fire, and we usually accomplish at least one major adventure (climbing, hiking, canyoneering). Great fun is had by all. 

This year, I took the opportunity to pitch my idea of creating my own magazine to the group gathered at the perversion.  There were about 30 people there that I could pitch it to.  I didn't pitch it to all, but a select few who I thought would be interested. 

Over the last year, I have hesitated to pitch my idea to too many people. Sometimes people who first hear of it are really excited about it.  Other times, they are not. Actually most the time they are not.  So many people don't have the urge to write and don't necessarily understand why anyone would want to write for fun.  Writing is a skill they use at work and do not care to do on their free time.  I think they are insane. This blog is literally an outlet for me when I feel the urge to write.  My urge comes and goes throughout the year, as you can probably tell by my post history. But it always come back, and I am always excited about writing.  

At the perversion, I spoke with three people who were particularly excited about the magazine: Steve, Bonnie and Aaron.  Steve shares the same passion I do for writing. He spends free time daily writing ideas down.  He also shares my want to get his ideas out in the world.  Steve had several article ideas that were ready for creation. Bonnie is a journalism major and wants to write. And Aaron, although maybe the least enthusiastic, is probably the most valuble person I talked to. He is a longtime editor for pretty big newspapers. He currently works for the Sacremento Bee. His lack in enthusiasm was no doubt a result of the fact that he has to edit for a living. 

As with all perversions, I have come home with something valuble. A path forward for a magazine.
