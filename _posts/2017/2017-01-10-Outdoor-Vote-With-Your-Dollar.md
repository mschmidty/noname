With the enactment of the Bears Ears National Monument by the Obama administration, Utah politicians have done their damnedest to fight the new designation.  A recent op-ed (1/10/2016) in the Salt Lake Tribune by Black Diamond founder Peter Metcalf offers a warning to political leaders who are trying to damage the outdoor industry. His recommendation, move Outdoor Retailer from Salt Lake, where it currently resides, to a state that is more friendly to the public lands and the outdoor industry.  Outdoor Retailer is the largest outdoor convention in the country with approximately [50,000 attendees](http://www.outdoorretailer.com/static/pdf/SM15-Postshow-Report.pdf) to both the summer and winter editions. Moving it would be huge hit to Salt Lake Cities Economy.  

[From the op-ed](http://www.sltrib.com/opinion/4798906-155/op-ed-time-for-outdoor-retailers-to):

> Political officials rationalize their actions with false truths, fictional ideologically based narratives and fear-mongering. They neglect the critical role public lands play in boosting Utah's economy, making the state a great place to live, work and play. They even fail to understand that four of Utah's five iconic national parks, which are the economic engines of their regions, were created through use of the Antiquities Act â€” as was Bears Ears National Monument.

> This agenda is antithetical to our industry, let alone the majority of our citizens regardless of party affiliation. By our industry's twice-annual trade show remaining in Utah, we are actually complicit collaborators in our own demise. It's time for the industry to again find its voice, speak truth and power to power while making it clear to the governor and the state's political leadership that this trade show will depart with the expiration of the current contract in 2018 unless the leadership ceases its assault on America's best idea.

I have to admit, I don't completely understand how Utah officials are so opposed to public lands designations.  Yes, they have to potential to impact non-renewable industries and the livestock grazing industry.  But that is not necessarily the case with a National Monument designation, Canyons of the Ancients National Monument has both grazing and oil and gas. Public lands have practically made Utah what it is today. Moab would not  exist without Arches, Canyonlands and the BLM. Springville would be a spec without Zion. Salt Lake City's tourist industry would be a fraction of what it is today without the Ski areas leased from the Forest Service in nearby canyons. And I would think that a huge driver in why Utah is [one of the fastest growing states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_by_population_growth_rate) has a great deal to do with its public lands and recreational opportunities.  

Than again, Utah has done a great job [attracting large businesses with tax credits and incentives](http://business.utah.gov/programs/incentives/) providing jobs. Similarly, very few incentives exist for small businesses within the state. The incentive for many, it seems, is the outdoor opportunities that Utah is now fighting. 

All of this makes me wonder if Utah is in a bubble that it can't sustain.  It seems like they give tax breaks to big businesses that are paid for by small businesses.  As America is finding out this election, taking advantage of the middle class, can lead to some [severe consequences](https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/donald-trump). Time will tell.
