It appears that the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, once again, is [likely to be opened][1] for oil and gas development.  The latest push to open the refuge has come, in part, as a response to falling oil and gas revenues in Alaska.  It is thought, that the increase in production in the state would help fill the gap. Conservationists, such as myself, are dismayed that with almost the rest of United States available for oil and gas development, why must we drill here? 

## History 

The 19 million acre refuge was first protected in 1960 by the Secretary of the Interior, under President Eisenhower. In 1980, Congress passed the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. However, the area currently being looked at for drilling, the coastal plain known in the act as the 1002 area, was set aside in the act surface oil and gas exploration. This area could be drilled with only after authorization from congress. It is important to understand that attempt to drill in the refuge do not cover the entire area.  Instead they focus on the coastal plain an area covered in section 1002 of the act. 

## The Debate

It is no longer up for debate, Oil and Gas development has both local and global negative effects on the environment.  Production of oil and gas, locally, fragments ecosystems, removes habitat and disturbs wildlife. Globally, the burning of fossil fuels contributes to climate change, which effects ecosystems world wide.      

However, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, debate really centers around if the amount of oil in the Refuge is worth causing these impacts. Seismic studies
