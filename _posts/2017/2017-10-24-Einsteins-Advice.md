There are not many notable people in history that are remembered as fondly as Albert Einstein. For good reason too. Einstein published over 300 papers in his life and developed the theory of relativity, one of two pillars of modern physics.  Einstein is remembered so fondly for more than his scientific achievements, however. In world war II he warned of other countries developing a catastrophic weapon, the atomic bomb, and urged the US to make something similar.  Only later to ask that such a weapon not be used. 

I'm writing all this because this morning I read an article about how on a speaking tour Einstein would tip couriers with hand written notes.  Given, my current state in life, the excerpts seemed quite timely.  Hopefully you enjoy them as I did: 

> “A calm and modest life brings more happiness than the pursuit of success combined with constant restlessness,”

This was from a letter Einstein wrote in 1950: 

> “If God has created the world, his primary worry was certainly not to make its understanding easy for us,”

The man could say a lot in so very few words.
