There are not many notable people in history that are remembered as fondly as Albert Einstein. For good reason too. Einstein published over 300 papers in his life and developed the theory of relativity, one of two pillars of modern physics.  Though, Einstein is remembered so fondly for more than his scientific achievements. I grew up with a picture of Einstein on my wall with a quote: 

>  "Imagination is more important than knowledge."

I'm writing all this because this morning I read an article about how a notes the Einstein wrote are up for auction.  Some of these notes he gave to friends, others he gave randomly as tips to a courier in Tokyo:  

> “A calm and modest life brings more happiness than the pursuit of success combined with constant restlessness,”

This was from a letter Einstein wrote in 1950: 

> “If God has created the world, his primary worry was certainly not to make its understanding easy for us,”

The man could say a lot in so very few words.
