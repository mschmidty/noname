This blog started on December 11, 2016. Since then I've written 7 posts.  Two I've started and will be coming out shortly.  If you include this post, that will be 8 posts finished and 2 started in about 22 days.  Not bad.  

I started this blog because I have an urge to write.  Writing is something that I have always enjoyed doing, but never really thought I was good at.  I'm a firm believer in practice. The only way to get really good at something is to do it a lot. This blog is my practice. 

There are also so many ideas in my head.  I tend to think I think a little differently then some and I'd like to get my ideas out of my head and onto paper (or screen). 

To make this site better, I thought that it would be good to make some concrete goals for the year. These goals will be a mix of personal goals and goals for the site. You can't have one without the other in my opinion. 

### Publish 39 Posts
39??? Where did you get 39?  At first I wanted to publish 52 posts, one post for every week of the year.  I decided this would be a little too ambitious for my first year and I want to focus on quality, not quantity. So I reduced that number by a quarter  52 * .75 = 39.  

### Read 12 Books
I had the same goal last year and only made it to 7. This year I want to try again. [Strangers in Their Own Land by Arlie Russell Hochschild][strangers] is first up, followed by:

* [Prisoners of Geography](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25135194-prisoners-of-geography) by Tim Marshall
* [The Other Slavery ](http://www.npr.org/2016/04/17/471622218/horrors-pile-up-quietly-in-the-other-slavery) by Anders Resendez
* [House of Rain ](http://www.houseofrain.com/bookdetail.cfm?id=1183863026528) by Craig Childs
* [The Attention Merchants and the Master Switch](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/03/books/review-attention-merchants-tim-wu.html?_r=0) by Tim Wu

That should get me through Mayish.  After that I'd like to read some fiction. Any suggestions?

### Publish an Online Magazine. 

This is a little out there and the details are just starting to form. There really is no draw back to trying though. I might write a bit about it here. 

### Get Outside....and Watch less TV!

I spend incrementally more time in front of a computer these days. I like the idea that at least one to two days of every week is spent completely outside with no digital stimulus (no headphones nothing).

That sounds like enough.  I don't want to get too excited and make goals I can't finish.  Happy New Year.  Here's to 2017.
