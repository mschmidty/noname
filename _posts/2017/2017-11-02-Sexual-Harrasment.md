In the last few weeks, everyday there is another allegation of sexual assault the comes to light. For instance, after earlier in the week finding out the NPR's Senior Vice President for News [resigned over sexual harassment claims dating back 20 years][1], I open Google news to find that Dustin Hoffman is [now being accused][2] of sexually harassing by a TV producer. (the [interview of NPR CEO Jarl Mohn by Mary Louise Kelly][1] is amazing, do listen to the segment).  These allegations are in addition to recent stories about sexual harassment by Bill Cosby, Bill O'Reilly, Donald Trump, Harvey Weinstein, Kevin Spacey and, sadly, many more. 

As a man, I'm deeply saddened and appalled that my sex includes such vile creatures.  But I'm also surprised.  I have had several conversation over the last year pushing the idea that we have reached the end of workplace explicit discrimination based on sex. Instead, I truly believed that we had entered an era where the gender wage gap was no longer a result of outright discrimination, but instead was a systemic issues in the workplace.  I believed that women exclusively were paid less because they needed more flexibility because they took care and had children.  There is [evidence for this sort of perspective][3], and I even think it's true. But after all of the sexual harassment claims and the [#MeToo][4] movement, my perspective has changed on how women are treated in our society and I am appalled that I have given so much attention to the systemic wage-gap theory and avoided how poorly some women are treated by men. 

And unfortunately, as much as I want this story to be about the women, the victims who have been wronged, for me my transition in perspective has come down to the Men who I know in my life.  Since the election of Donald Trump, men that I know have routinely been apologetic of sexual harassment. When Donald Trump's "they let you grab them by the pussy" comments came to light, I had friends say that it was common place, that "we all do it".  When I replied: "yeah we can say bad stuff, but we never locker room talk about sexual harassment", they all awkwardly laughed and shrugged as if to say, "come on, we all do it". The conversation ended. Let's be clear, I think women are beautiful.  I have said so much to my friends in private. And I have been a horny young man who has talked about wanting women. All of those things are OK. But one, I never talked about grabbing a women, or using a women and, two, even if I had, I still think as a society, the comments and actions from men across the country should be whole heartedly condemned, not awkwardly shrugged off and excepted and as an adult I'd hope that I could right my wrongs. 

And that isn't the only story, just two weeks ago I had a guy at a wedding try to tell me that he slapped a girls ass (a coworker of his, and a friend of mine), and she was pissed.  He thought she was over reacting.  To knock me off my high horse, I should of said something, but I didn't.  I just awkwardly shrugged my shoulders and laughed in discomfort. 

These events and the mounting allegations in the news, have left me wanting to issue an apology to all  of the women who I have mansplained the real issue with the gender wage gap to. I stand by what I think of the wage gap and I still want to make the work place more flexible and accommodating to both men and women who have children.  But I completely revoke any time that I said that workplace discrimination was a thing of the pass.  I hope you can forgive me for being such an insensitive ass. I know I have talked with some women, who have been sexually harassed in the workplace, about this topic.  And I didn't understand why they were so pissed.  Now I understand.  Now I see the problem.  And I am sorry to you, those who I have ignored because some stupid study says there is an average that means absolutely nothing compared to you, who have had to be treated like shit by a man. I now know sexual predatory men are out there, and they are prevalent.  And I will try not to be silent.
