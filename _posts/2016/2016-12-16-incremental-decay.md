I woke up this morning and read the paper.  In the New York Times  was an [Op-Ed by a Midwesterner republican Talk Radio host, Charlie Sykes][nyt]. In the article he partially credits the direction of his party and the election of Donald Trump with making his step down from radio easier - he ultimately credits personal reasons, however.

In particular, Mr. Sykes critiques what he sees as tribalism in both his party and politics in general in America.  

> In this binary tribal world, where everything is at stake, everything is in play, there is no room for quibbles about character, or truth, or principles. If everything — the Supreme Court, the fate of Western civilization, the survival of the planet — depends on tribal victory, then neither individuals nor ideas can be determinative. I watched this play out in real time, as conservatives who fully understood the threat that Mr. Trump posed succumbed to the argument about the Supreme Court. As even Mr. Ryan discovered, neutrality was not acceptable; if you were not for Mr. Trump, then you were for Mrs. Clinton.

I agree with him on this.  I think we have become so entrenched in our own political ideas that we have stopped seeing people on the other side of the political divide as equals. This fact has turned our elections into who can make it through the primaries and elections without losing it.  Our politics is no longer about the battle of arguments, it is about staying loyal to those in your tribe no matter the level of un-professionalism displayed by their candidate. Or even worse, no matter how much it might [negatively effect you][vox1]!

One thing I think is missed in the article, however, is why we are so tribal.  In this, you see an omission from Mr. Sykes. We should all shoulder the blame for climbing further into our political corners, but Mr. Sykes and other talk radio hosts need to admit their influential roles in pushing us there.

I commend Mr. Sykes in his rebuke of his own party.  I do not commend the fact that he will not and cannot see his own contribution to its current state.  How can you call a left leaning chancellor a "lefty" or consistently tweet about "Anti-Christian Bigotry and Rank Political Posturing" without realizing that you are directly fueling what Sykes calls "binary tribal[ism]".  

We need to move away from the all too common: "The left did it and its bad" to "this idea is bad and this is why". That does not mean that we can never attribute an idea to a party, it just means that we need to stop using political labels as a critique. 

I find it horribly hypocritical that a man that has done so much to contribute to tribalism, is so irritated that it is occurring.  I would have hoped that in his article he would at least mention that he is partially responsible. To be fair, he is not the only one who has been pushing this one sided - "Binary" - world.  The left has done it's fair share as well. But if you look through tweets from commentators on the left, it is much harder to find the divisiveness that you see on the right. There is no equivalent to Rush Limbaugh on the left. 

And quite frankly Donald Trump campaigned on so many of the ideas that have been supported by the Republican party for decades, he just has taken them to an extreme.  The right has been fighting for tougher treatment "Islamic Terrorists", Trump recommends a band on all Muslims entering the country. The right crows about immigrants ruining our country, Trump calls Mexicans rapists and drug dealer and promises to build a wall.  The right calls the left criminal and Trump says he'll lock Hillary up!  

The sad thing is, I believe that we need the rights ideas now more than ever.  Not the ones listed above, of course.  But we really need someone in on the conversation that doesn't think continued increases in spending are good all of the time. These ideas however have been squashed by the continued weponization of party politics. And unfortunately, I think now, we have a right leaning weapon as president.
