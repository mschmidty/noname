This election has been hard. As much as I say I am not a liberal.  I am.  Many liberal ideas lost this presidential elections with the selection so president elect, Donald Trump.  I've tried over and over in my head to try and figure out how and why this happened.  My idea of America couldn't elect a man who was so crude, mean and disrespectful.  My American never would have supported someone who brings out the worst of America's racist past, who mocks a disabled person, who so openly rejects people are different. I knew that some would support Donald Trump just because they are republicans.  I suspected that others would vote for trump because they were really frustrated with president Obama.  But I never suspected that the vast majority of white people would vote for Trump.  I thought that at some level, we would reject all of the terrible things that Donald Trump stands for.  But we didn't. 

I live in a conservative county in Colorado.  The type of county that overwhelmingly voted for Donald Trump. Since the election I on more than one occasion have been in the situation where I am talking with someone who I never would have suspected to be a trump supporter and then they are.
