In ["Science Isn't Broken"][538] by Five Thirty Eight, [Christie Aschwande][CA] asks the question: is science broken?  At the onset it appears os. REcent headlines such as a journal publishing a study called "Get Me off your F***king Mailing list" make a pretty strong case that our trust in the Scientific Method should be questioned. Other issues with science such as the fact that scientist have to make decisions that can impact their results are also brought up.  

An interactive tool which allows you to manipulate the terms of a study on the relationship between political part and the success of the economy demonstrates the decisions considered by researchers and illustrates the consequences of those decisions quite well.  

The article ultimately makes the case that science is indeed not broken, but that changes would improve its ability to get at truth. More importantly though is that Science fundamentally works based on repetition and replacement or addition.  Studies need to be repeated.  Repeated studies may confirm a results or not.  If results confirm a previous study, the evidence is strengthened. If repeat study results differ, or contradict, the original results, the new information is added to the scientific lexicon and further study is conducted. Science is anything but static. 

From the article: 

> “A p-value does not give you that — it can never give you that,” said Regina Nuzzo, a statistician and journalist in Washington, D.C., who wrote about the p-value problem in Nature last year. Instead, you can think of the p-value as an index of surprise. How surprising would these results be if you assumed your hypothesis was false?

I really like that last bit as an explanation of what a p-value actually is. 

> ...researcher John Ioannidis concluded, in a famous 2005 paper, that most published research findings are false. “It’s really difficult to perform a good study,” he told me, admitting that he has surely published incorrect findings too. “There are so many potential biases and errors and issues that can interfere with getting a reliable, credible result.” Yet despite this conclusion, Ioannidis has not sworn off science. Instead, he’s sworn to protect it.

> The important lesson here is that a single analysis is not sufficient to find a definitive answer. Every result is a temporary truth, one that’s subject to change when someone else comes along to build, test and analyze anew.

> What makes science so powerful is that it’s self-correcting — sure, false findings get published, but eventually new studies come along to overturn them, and the truth is revealed. 

Personally, I don't believe science is broken. Rather, I think peoples understanding of science has lead them to believe that science is broken. That's not to say that science is a perfect profession. Just read a medical history book such as [The Gene][TG] which details the scientific communities several attempts at human eugenics.  The history of science is riddled with mistakes, some intentional and some not. However, the thing that I think people so often get wrong is, science is not important because it is always correct. It is important because it gives us an evidence based structure to document and learn about things and it is a mechanism for questioning what is known.  When done correctly, science is always trying to get humanity closer to the truth.  If we already knew the truth about everything, there would be no point to conduct science after all.   

### Note: 
The graphics by [Richie King][RK] in the article are particularly impressive.  I highly recommend looking into some of the other interactive web data he's made.
