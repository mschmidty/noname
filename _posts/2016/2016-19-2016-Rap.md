I saw [Brother Ali](http://brotherali.com/) this weekend.  In 2004, it was his album Shadows on the Sun that showed me that rap could be about more than gang banging. Ali's performance was truly inspiring.  As a white albino Muslim, you feel like you know who Ali is listening to him. Some of my favorites: 

> You might think I'm depressed as can be <br>
But when I look in the mirror I see sexy ass me <br>
And if that's somethin' that you cant respect then that's peace <br>
My life's better without you actually <br>
To everyone out there, who's a little different <br>
I say damn a magazine, these are gods fingerprints <br>
You can call me ugly but cant take nothing from me <br>
I am what I am doctor you ain't gotta love me <br>
- "Forest Whitiker" - Shadows on the Sun

> Trapped in a history we don't understand <br>
Can't remember how this blood got on our hands <br>
Never been taught about the ugly past <br>
Expecting God not to punish man <br>
Our ancestors brought us control <br>
We realize now that the cost was our soul <br>
Got me feeling like an empty shell <br>
Prison guard that inherited a cell<br>
I'm desperate to find my place <br>
Emptiness lies behind my face <br>
Flowers only die in a vase <br>
A heart only dies encased in a lie we call race <br>
I hear the song but I can't sing along <br>
Some thing's really wrong I can't put my finger on <br>
Terrified to admit it's wrong <br>
Cause I'm hiding in the ruins of a legacy that still lives on <br>
Our identity is hinged upon the miserable myth we've been caught since we're born <br>
Until we mend what was torn <br>
The debt of a sin lingers long after the victim's moans <br>
This is actually true <br>
Now stop and imagine that's you <br>
Now stop imagining unravel the truth <br>
And ask just who is it happening to <br>
Everything that the passenger do the driver experience too <br>
So if humanity is one then we all get burned when it's hell that we're traveling through <br>
