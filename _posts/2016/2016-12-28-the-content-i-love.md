The internet has given the world an endless sea of content. Some is good, some is terrible, some is true, and some is thoughtful. This is the content that I love. 

## News

* **[National Public Radio](http://one.npr.org/)** - Morning edition and All Things Considered are an important part of my day. 
* **[The New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/)** - Immediately after the election I purchased a subscription to the New York Times.  I decided that add driven content comes at a price and paying for good content is important. 
* **[Quartz](http://qz.com)** - Figure driven reporting that never tries to be the first to report something. 
* **[The Wall Street Journal](http://www.wsj.com/)** - Admittedly I don't read the Wall Street Journal.  However, it is to the right of the New York Times and I think it is important to have a foot on both sides of the political line. 
* **[Vox](http://www.vox.com/)** - Vox's reporting on the Affordable Care Act by Sarah Kliff was and continues to be Amazing.  Ezra Klein, the Editor and Chief, is also someone who always expands my perspective. 
* **[FiveThirtyEight](http://fivethirtyeight.com/)** - Five Thirty Eight brings a data driven approach to news - something more news outlets should strive to do.  They were very good at polling the presidential election and their reporting on guns is amazing.  
* **[Marginal Revolution](http://marginalrevolution.com/)** - This blog is my latest find, thanks to the Ezra Klein Show. It's written by Tyler Cohen.  He has a way of putting things that I think about into simple easy to digest short snippets.  Don't expect anything polished.  Just thoughts and quotes. Awesome. 
* **[High Country News](https://www.hcn.org)** - The best reporting on issues that we face in the west, hands down. 
* **[Sagebrush Altered](http://sagebrushaltered.com/)** - Ahem


## Podcasts

There are a ton of great Podcasts out there.  This list is by no means comprehensive.  Here I'll focus on podcasts that I enjoy that I haven't heard many others recommend. 

* **[The Weeds](http://www.vox.com/the-weeds)** - An in depth policy podcast. The three hosts Ezra Klein, Sarah Kliff and Matt Iglesias do a great job getting into the political weeds on a wide range of topics. They are particularly good at bringing complex issues down to an understandable level. 
* **[The Ezra Klein Show](http://www.vox.com/ezra-klein-show-podcast)** - Ezra interviews really smart people and he asks great questions. 
* **[More Perfect](http://www.wnyc.org/shows/radiolabmoreperfect)** - Another great podcast from the folks at Radiolab.  Each episode covers a supreme court ruling.  It will change how you think about the law. 
* **[Revisionist History](http://revisionisthistory.com/)** - Malcolm Gladwell's podcast that aims to change the way you think about history.  Each episode tackles a moment in history that you think you understand but don't. 
* **[NPR Politics Podcast](http://www.npr.org/podcasts/510310/npr-politics-podcast)** - This one single handedly got me through the election. 
* **[A History of Oil](http://historyofoil.typepad.com/)** - This should be required listening for everyone.  It explains so much about how the world works.  Oil is indeed the product that shapped our modern world. 
* The better known podcasts that I really enjoy: 
  - [Freakenomics](http://freakonomics.com/archive/)
  - [Radiolab](http://www.radiolab.org/)
  - [This American Life](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/) - The episode on Hillary Clintons email server is a [must listen](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/601/master-of-her-domain-name).
  - [Planet Money](http://www.npr.org/sections/money/)
  - [Serial](https://serialpodcast.org/)

I hope you enjoy these as much as I do.  I also like to read books, but do it far less than I should. Although it will be short, I'm working on putting out a list of books that enjoyed reading this year. 

Happy new year!
