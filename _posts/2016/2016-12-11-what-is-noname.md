So what is this Sagebrush Altered blog all about? To be honest, I don't really know yet. I started another blog that was intended to be a platform to blog about my work as a wildlife biologist for the Bureau of Land Management.  I'll keep that blog going along with this one.  However, writing about land management is better suited to a technical style which is less fun to do when you do it for work so often.  I want to have an outlet where I can write more freely and be less professional.  I want a space where I can enjoy writing more freely withouth the contraints of being scientific all of the time.  

And so we have Sagebrush Altered.  The name came out of the landscape that inhabitit.  I live and work in the western United States, Colorado specifically.  The vast majority of the western landscape is covered by sagebrush, an ecosystem that in the last 200 plus years has gone through an irreversable transformation.  This transformation is similar to the transformation that is currently occuring in the communities in so many areas in rural America, a place that I love and live. 

The general theme of this blog will be:

> Ramblings in the rural American West.
