So what is this no name blog? To be honest, I don't really know yet. I started another blog [schmidtyworks.com][schmidtyworks] that was intended to be a platform to blog about my work as a wildlife biologist for the Bureau of Land Management.  I'll keep that blog going along with this one.  But writing about land management is better suited to a technical style.  While I think writing technically would help me grow as a biologist,  I also want to have an outlet where I can write more freely.  

And so we have No Name.  I don't know if that name will stick.  I just needed to get started. 

The general theme of this blog will be:

> Ramblings in the rural American West.
