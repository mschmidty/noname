> Our polarization, and the increasing reality that we simply don't know each other, makes it too easy to settle for dislike and contempt. - pg. xii

> ...politics is the single biggest factor determining the views on climate change.  - pg 7 (Also includes stats on what proportion of political groups believe in Climate change.)

> Finally, we came to Madonna's basic feeling that Limbaugh was defending her against insults she felt liberals were lobbing at her: "Oh, liberals think that Bible-believing Southerners are ignorant, backward, redneck, losers.  The think we're racist, sexist homophobic, and maybe fat. "

> "Part of the psychological program is that people think they're free when they're not," he said. "A company may be free to pollute, but that means the people aren't free to swim." - General Honore - Pg 71

> In the speeches of Congressmen Boustany, Landry, and Vitter, and of Governor Jindal, a certain logic unfolded.  These were leaders my Tea Party friends gladly voted into office, and so I wanted to understand this logic, see if it made any sense to me, and figure out why it made sense to them.  
>   The logic was this.  The more oil, the more jobs. The more jobs, the more prosperity, and the less need for government aid.  And the less the people depend on the government -- local, state or federal --the better off they will be.  So to attract more oil jobs, the state has to offer financial "incentives" to oil companies to get them to come.  That incentive money will have to be drawn from the state budget, which may lead to the firing of public sector workers, which painful as it might seem, reduces reliance on government and lowers taxes.  It is red state logic. But the paradox is that it goes with being a poor state with a lot of problems. - Pg. 73

> Many Louisianans I spoke with told me that, either by intent or in effect, environmental regulations kill jobs. This was the idea behind talk of "environmental wackos."  But Templet refers me to a 1992 study by the MIT political scientist Stephen Meyer, who rated the fifty states according to the strictness of their environmental protection.  Meyer then matched the regulatory strictness to economic growth over a twenty-year period and found that the tougher the regulation, the more jobs were available in the economy.  A 2016 survey of the world's major economies also found that strict environmental policies improved, rather than handicapped, competitiveness in the international market.  If this was the growing consensus among Organizations for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) economists, I wondered why my Tea Party friends weren't hearing about it.  - Pg 78  

Look into - Risk Screening Environmental Indicators from the EPA and the General Social Survey. - Pg 79

> Mike Schaff Did neither...."I used to use the 'N' word, and a lto of black kids I palyed with did too.  But I stopped that back in 1968. I remember yelling from the stnads of my college football stadium in 1968, rooting for our best player. 'Run! Nigger! Run!' And the next year in 1969 I was yelling, 'Run! Joe! Run!' I haven't used the word since.  I look forward to a day when color just won't matter at all.  I think we're halfway there."
