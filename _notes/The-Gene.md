> ...Our genes do not keep spitting out stereotypical responses to idiosyncratic environments: if they did, we too would devolve into windup automations.  Hindu philosophers have long described the experience of "being" as a web - jaal. Genes from the threads of the web;the detritus that sticks is what transforms every individual web into a being.  There is an exquisite precision in that mad scheme. Genes must carry out programmed responses to environments - otherwise, there would be no conserved form.  But they must also leave exactly enough room for the vagaries of chance to stick.  We call this intersection "fate". We call our responses to it "choice". An upright organism with opposable thumbs is thus build from a script, but built to go off script. We call one such unique variant of one such organism a "self".  - pg. 390, The Gene

> The flow of information si the closest thing that we might have to a biological law. When the technology to manipulate this law is mastered, we will move through one of the most profound transitions in our history.  We will learn to read and write our selves, ourselves. - pg. 410 (There is also a chart of the flow of information)

> The point of this: if you cannot separate the *phenotype* of mental illness from creative impulse.  The genes that "cause" one (bipolar disease) will "cause" another (creative effervescent).  This conundrum brings us to Victor McKusick's understanding of illness - not as absolute disability but as a relative incongruence between the genotype and the environment.  A child with a high-functioning form of autism may be impaired in this world, but might be hyperfunctional in another - one in which, say, the performance of complex arithmetic calculations, or the sorting of objects by subtlest gradations of color, is a requirement of survival for success.  - pg. 448.
